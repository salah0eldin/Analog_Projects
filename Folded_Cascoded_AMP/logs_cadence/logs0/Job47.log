*Error*   Error ID  = 5011
*Error*   Error Msg = Simulator failed to complete the simulation.

          The simulator integration (OASIS) has reported an
          unsuccessful simulation.
While this validity check is
          dependent on the particular simulator's OASIS
          integration,
with the default Cadence-provided checks
          common causes for this failure are:
1. Missing simulation
          /psf directory containing simulation output files.
2.
          Simulation output files (e.g., PSF) that do not contain any
          successful analyses.
Check the simulator's output log for
          more information.
./runSimulation can be manually run in
          this directory to check the issue.




Simulation design variables differ from those on the cellView,
they have been saved in the file "/tmp/saved-design-variables".
